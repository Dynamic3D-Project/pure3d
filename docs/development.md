# Development

## Recommended Local Workflow

Use `make dev` for a Docker frontend, PocketBase, and MinIO. Use `make dev-web`
for the same local services with a native Bun frontend. Neither command needs a
production `.env` to be replaced or edited.

| Command                         | Behavior                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `make dev`                      | Full local Docker development stack                          |
| `make dev-cert`                 | Trust mkcert CA and generate missing HTTPS certificate       |
| `make dev-web` / `make bun-dev` | Local Docker services, native Bun frontend                   |
| `make install`                  | Provision local services, Voyager, and available assets      |
| `make db`                       | Start local PocketBase and MinIO                             |
| `make seed-assets`              | Mirror `static/project/` into the local MinIO bucket         |
| `make stack`                    | Start all local Compose services                             |
| `make db-logs` / `make db-stop` | Follow logs / stop local backend services                    |
| `make stack-stop`               | Stop the local Compose stack                                 |
| `make dev-prod`                 | Local Docker frontend connected to live OVH, no dependencies |

Obtain private seed data from a maintainer for `data/json-output/` and assets for
`static/project/`. Run `make seed-assets` after adding assets. Legacy
`project/<collection>/<edition>/...` storage paths are preserved. Seed data and
assets are not downloaded from production by these commands.

## Configuration Contract

Local commands select `docker-compose.yml` plus `docker-compose.local.yml`:

- Browser frontend/PocketBase base URL: `https://127.0.0.1:${FRONTEND_PORT:-60020}`.
- Browser assets: `https://127.0.0.1:${FRONTEND_PORT:-60020}/assets`.
- Native Vite HTTPS proxies `/api` to PocketBase and `/assets` to MinIO with the
  prefix rewritten to `/${R2_BUCKET:-pure3d-assets}/...`; legacy asset paths remain unchanged.
- Private `DEV_HTTPS=1`, `DEV_POCKETBASE_TARGET`, `DEV_ASSET_TARGET`, and `DEV_ASSET_BUCKET`
  configure this routing. Docker targets are `http://pocketbase:8090` and `http://minio:9000`;
  native targets are `http://127.0.0.1:${POCKETBASE_PORT:-60021}` and
  `http://127.0.0.1:${MINIO_API_PORT:-60023}`. Never use `PUBLIC_` or `VITE_` for these internals.
- Operator PocketBase UI remains `http://localhost:${POCKETBASE_PORT:-60021}/_/`.
- Setup PocketBase: `http://pocketbase:8090`.
- Setup storage endpoint: `http://minio:9000`, using `MINIO_ROOT_USER` and
  `MINIO_ROOT_PASSWORD`, not production `R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`.
- PocketBase ORCID issuer: `https://orcid.org` (real ORCID, not sandbox).
- Local Bun containers receive empty `ORCID_CLIENT_ID` and `ORCID_CLIENT_SECRET`
  so mounted `.env` files cannot automatically supply production credentials.
- Native Bun exports explicit local public URLs and empty ORCID credentials
  **after** sourcing `.env`.

Existing `FRONTEND_PORT` (60020), `POCKETBASE_PORT` (60021), `MINIO_API_PORT`
(60023), and `MINIO_CONSOLE_PORT` (60024) remain configurable. Container ports
remain 14273, 8090, 9000, and 9001. Existing credential defaults are unchanged.

Use the Make targets, not bare `docker compose up` or `bun run dev`, for this
isolation contract. The base Compose file alone still accepts environment settings.

## Local Certificate Trust

Install mkcert first (`brew install mkcert` on macOS). `make dev`, `make dev-web`, and
`make stack` depend on `make dev-cert`. If either certificate file is missing, the target
runs `mkcert -install` to trust its development CA and generates `.certs/localhost.pem`
and `.certs/localhost-key.pem` with SANs `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and `::1`.
The key is restricted to mode 600 and `.certs/` is ignored by Git.

CA installation can ask for administrator approval. Trust is local to your machine/browser;
restart the browser after installation, and follow mkcert's browser-specific trust instructions
if necessary. Never commit or share certificate keys or the CA private key in `mkcert -CAROOT`.
If macOS cannot show its approval prompt from an automation session, run `mkcert -install`
directly in your Terminal, approve it there, and rerun `make dev-cert`.
Use `https://127.0.0.1:60020`, not literal `localhost`: ORCID's web validator rejects a hostname
without a dot, while an HTTPS IP callback is accepted. No new service or host port is used.
Vite reads certificates only for its development server with `DEV_HTTPS=1`, never during
build or preview. The HTTPS server fails rather than silently selecting a different port.

## Live OVH Opt-In

```sh
make dev-prod
```

**Connected to production: changes affect live data.**

This selects `docker-compose.yml` plus `docker-compose.prod.yml` and runs
`up --no-deps frontend`. It forces PocketBase to
`https://main.57-129-98-223.sslip.io` and assets to
`https://main.57-129-98-223.sslip.io/assets`, regardless of `.env` public settings.
It does not start backend/setup dependencies, stop existing local services, or
manage any production services. No UI mode flag is required; the actual
PocketBase URL identifies the connection.

The frontend is plain HTTP at `http://localhost:${FRONTEND_PORT:-60020}` in this mode.
`DEV_HTTPS=0` is forced to prevent shared `.env` settings from enabling local proxies or
certificate loading. `make dev-prod` has no certificate prerequisite.

The development header shows an amber **production db** label underneath the logo when its
actual PocketBase URL points to OVH, and a blue **dev** label in local mode. Neither label
appears in production builds. Login sessions and catalogue caches are separated by backend
URL during development, so switching modes does not inherit the other mode's
session or cached data. Existing production-build session storage is unchanged.

The Bun scripts explicitly set `NODE_ENV=development` for the dev server and
`NODE_ENV=production` for builds. A value inherited from `.env` cannot make a
production build display development-only UI.

## Local Real ORCID

Normal `make dev` does not run `configure-orcid.ts --apply` or an automatic OAuth
cutover. Reuse the existing **real ORCID OAuth application** and your real ORCID account.
Sharing an identity provider does not share an application database: users, permissions,
editions, and sessions still belong to the separate local PocketBase, not OVH.
No sandbox application or account is needed.

In the existing ORCID application's registration, **add** this exact redirect URI:

```text
https://127.0.0.1:60020/api/oauth2-redirect
```

Keep every existing OVH callback and leave the real application URL pointing at OVH.
Do not replace the old callback. A custom `FRONTEND_PORT` requires an additional exact
allowlist entry with that port; changing only the Make port does not update ORCID.

Keep the existing real client ID and secret in private `.env`. Local frontend/setup
containers deliberately receive blank credentials, so merely starting the stack cannot
configure OAuth. Run the existing tool explicitly on the host. Inspect its offline instructions:

Rotating the shared ORCID client secret requires updating both PocketBase configurations;
it does not synchronize accounts, roles, or data between those databases.

```sh
bun --no-env-file scripts/configure-orcid.ts
```

For preparation, override the database destination explicitly. These commands assume default
ports and local superuser credentials in `.env`; supply your local superuser values privately
if that file instead contains OVH admin credentials. Never print or paste secrets into logs:

```sh
POCKETBASE_URL=http://localhost:60021 \
PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL=https://127.0.0.1:60020 \
ORCID_ISSUER=https://orcid.org ORCID_ENVIRONMENT=production \
bun --env-file=.env scripts/configure-orcid.ts --prepare
```

Follow the tool's backup and privileged-account mapping requirements before
explicitly enabling real ORCID on the local database:

```sh
POCKETBASE_URL=http://localhost:60021 \
PUBLIC_POCKETBASE_URL=https://127.0.0.1:60020 \
ORCID_ISSUER=https://orcid.org ORCID_ENVIRONMENT=production \
bun --env-file=.env scripts/configure-orcid.ts --apply
```

`ORCID_ENVIRONMENT=production` selects the real identity provider, not the application
database. Apply changes authentication and invalidates existing user sessions; keep it on
the explicit local database and satisfy all backup and mapping gates in [ORCID operations](orcid.md).
Empty credentials do not enable sign-in, and imported records are not proof of verified ownership.

Until a provider is configured, the login screen displays an explicit
configuration message and disables sign-in instead of opening a popup that
immediately closes. Reload the page after completing provider configuration.

## Configuration Tests

```sh
bun test scripts/dev-commands.test.ts
```

These tests use `docker compose --env-file /dev/null ... config --format json`
with synthetic production values and `make -n` for command inspection. They
check default/custom ports, proxy targets, credential isolation, real issuer, exact OVH
endpoints, and production `--no-deps`. Certificate commands are inspected with `make -n` only;
tests never install a CA. They do not start or stop containers, contact services, or print
full resolved configuration or secrets.
